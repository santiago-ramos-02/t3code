# T3 Code

T3 Code is an "agent harness control surface". It enables control of the agents on your machine with a best-in-class mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t3-code-remote-claude-more/id6787819824), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.t3tools.t3code)), [web app](https://app.t3.codes) and [Electron-based desktop app](https://t3.codes).

Works with your subscriptions on Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Google Antigravity. If they're set up on your computer, T3 Code can control them.

## "Wait, what are you selling me?"

Nothing. We built T3 Code because we wanted the best possible development experience with agents. We were inspired by existing solutions like the Codex desktop app, Conductor, Claude Desktop and Cursor Glass, but none met our bar.

We wanted something performant, remote-ready, and truly open. If we ever go the wrong direction, we want you to have everything you need to fork and build the editor that you want.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> This is [santiago-ramos-02](https://github.com/santiago-ramos-02)'s fork of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code). It follows upstream closely and adds a full [Gentle AI](https://github.com/santiago-ramos-02/gentle-ai) integration. Every push to `main` publishes a new Nightly.

> [!WARNING]
> T3 Code currently supports Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, Antigravity, and Pi. Install and authenticate at least one provider before use:
>
> - Codex: install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run `codex login`
> - Claude: install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and run `claude auth login`
> - Cursor: install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) and run `agent login`
> - Grok Build: install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli) and run `grok login`
> - OpenCode: install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and run `opencode auth login`
> - Antigravity: enable it in Settings, then use **Install Antigravity** and **Sign in with Google**. No CLI is required.

### Desktop app

Download the latest **Nightly** for your system from [this fork's releases](https://github.com/santiago-ramos-02/t3code/releases):

| System               | File                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Windows              | `T3-Code-…-x64.exe`         |
| macOS, Apple Silicon | `T3-Code-…-arm64.dmg`       |
| macOS, Intel         | `T3-Code-…-x64.dmg`         |
| Linux                | `T3-Code-…-x86_64.AppImage` |

The app updates itself to each new Nightly. Windows and macOS may warn that the app is unsigned; choose **More info > Run anyway** on Windows, or **Open** from the Finder's context menu on macOS.

### Gentle AI

To use Gentle AI in T3 Code, install [this fork of gentle-ai](https://github.com/santiago-ramos-02/gentle-ai#get-started), which carries the API T3 Code uses:

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santiago-ramos-02/gentle-ai/main/scripts/t3-install.ps1 | iex
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santiago-ramos-02/gentle-ai/main/scripts/t3-install.sh | sh
```

Then open **Settings > Gentle AI** in T3 Code and set it up for the agents you use.
